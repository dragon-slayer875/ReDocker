# ReDocker

A simple containerization implementation from scratch.

Made use of Unix Namespaces and Unix system calls like unshare, clone.

(Currently a work in progress)

## To run:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dragon-slayer875/ReDocker.git
cd ReDocker

# Run
go run main.go run <shell command>
```
